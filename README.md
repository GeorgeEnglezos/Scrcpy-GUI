# üì± Scrcpy-GUI

Scrcpy-GUI is a lightweight user interface built with .NET MAUI for interacting with scrcpy v3.2 ‚Äî one of my favorite open-source tools. This app was created both as an experiment to explore .NET MAUI and to make scrcpy easier and more user-friendly.

With Scrcpy-GUI, you can:

    Easily generate scrcpy command-line arguments
