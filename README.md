# üì± Scrcpy-GUI

Scrcpy-GUI is a lightweight user interface built with .NET MAUI for interacting with [scrcpy v3.2](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) ‚Äî one of my favorite and most used open-source tools. Scrcpy by itself is a command-line project that allows you to stream and control your **Android** device on your PC in several powerful ways. This app was created both as an experiment to explore .NET MAUI and to make scrcpy more user-friendly.

With Scrcpy-GUI, you can:
- Easily generate more complex scrcpy command-line arguments
- Get full control of the Virtual displays and the ability to launch apps in there like launchers or gaming frontends
