# üì± Scrcpy-GUI

Scrcpy-GUI is a lightweight user interface built with .NET MAUI for interacting with [scrcpy v3.2](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) ‚Äî one of my favorite open-source tools.  
Scrcpy by itself is a command-line project that allows you to stream and control your **Android** device on your PC in several powerful ways.  
This app was created both as an experiment to explore .NET MAUI and to make scrcpy more user-friendly.

With Scrcpy-GUI, you can:

    Easily generate scrcpy command-line arguments
    
    Choose a package to launch in a virtual display from the installed applications in your Android device

    Launch apps directly in Virtual Displays
