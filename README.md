# üì± Scrcpy-GUI

Scrcpy-GUI is a lightweight user interface built with .NET MAUI for interacting with [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) ‚Äî one of my favorite and most used open-source tools. Scrcpy by itself is a command-line project that allows you to stream and control your **Android** device on your PC in several powerful ways. This app was created both as an experiment to explore .NET MAUI and to make scrcpy more user-friendly.

## With Scrcpy-GUI, you can:
- Easily generate complex scrcpy command-line arguments without wasting time digging through the official documentation.
- Take full control of virtual displays, including the ability to launch apps like launchers or gaming frontends.
- Save and manage shortcuts for your favorite commands, with the option to download them locally to your PC.
- Connect wirelessly with a single click‚Äîno hassle.
- Stream from multiple Android devices at the same time effortlessly.

# FAQs
- Is there a Linux port?
No unfortunately, .NET MAUI doesn't support Linux builds. To create a Linux port, I would need to migrate the project to another library.

- Is there a macOS port?
It's something I will explore soon. I don't own a macOS-powered machine, so I'll have to experiment with a VM, for which I'mm unsure of the compatibility.

- What's next for the project?
With the release of v1.5 I completely emptied my to-do list. Feel free to suggest any features.
