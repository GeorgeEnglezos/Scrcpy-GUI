# A Tour of the Scrcpy-GUI!

Let's take a quick walk through the Scrcpy-GUI application to get you familiar with its features and layout.

# Home Tab

This is your main page, where you'll find all the options needed for interacting with your Android device.

### Scrcpy Settings

These sections allow you to fine-tune how Scrcpy interacts with your device.

```
1) Select a Device: Scrcpy-GUI lets you cast from multiple Android devices simultaneously. Just pick the device you want to cast from the dropdown menu. If your device is connected via both Wi-Fi and a USB cable, you'll see both connection options listed.
```

```
2) Package Selector: Use this to choose an application from your phone and open it with Scrcpy, either on the main display or within a virtual display. This option might be a lifesaver if your Virtual Display doesn't show you the application menu. It is suggested to use a Frontend in that case like Daijishou, Nova launcher etc.

3) General Section: Here you'll find the most useful generic Scrcpy options. In case you ever need a parameter that's missing in the GUI write it in the Extra Parameters Text field.

4) Audio Section: Access various audio-related settings for your cast.

5) Virtual Display Section: Configure options for opening a new virtual display on your Android device. Combine it with the Package Selector for the best experience.

6) Recording Section: Settings for recording your Scrcpy cast.
```
